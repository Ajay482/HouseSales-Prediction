# HouseSales-Prediction


Goal is to develop a model that has the capacity of predicting the value of houses, we will split the dataset into features and the target variable and store them in features and prices variables.

The first problem was where can we get the data to build a large enough dataset since we want to be able to predict the price for a given house according to the real estate agency chosen.Firstly, we tried to find a dataset already done on the web and we gathered the data from kaggle.com .We have done this in  a python 3 Jupyter Notebook and executed the code snippet to load the dataset and remove the non-essential features. Receiving a success message if the actions were correctly performed.

Next, we tried to figure out what kind of chart we could use and it turns out that each one has its own advantage depending on what we want to visualize. We have started by creating some plots that will  allow us to visualize the pair-wise relationships and correlations between the different features. For our project we have used linear regression model and we have trained and tested our data for predicting the prices.
